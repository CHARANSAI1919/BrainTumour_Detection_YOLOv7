# BrainTumour_Detection_YOLOv7
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors in medical images using the YOLOv7 object detection model. The objective is to develop a fast and accurate system that can assist radiologists in identifying and localizing brain tumors from MRI scans.

YOLOv7 is a cutting-edge, one-stage object detector optimized for both speed and precision. Its architecture allows real-time inference while maintaining high detection accuracy, making it suitable for practical clinical applications.

The model was trained on annotated MRI images containing various types of brain tumors. This work aims to contribute toward the development of AI-assisted diagnostic tools in the field of medical imaging.

ðŸ“„ This project is part of a broader study on deep learning-based brain tumor detection using real-time object detectors.
